# skyscanner-task-project

## Here's some background information...
- Skyscanner is a search engine and travel agency that allows people to research and book travel options like flights, hotels, and car rentals. The company also created Backpack, an open-source collection of design resources and reusable guidelines, for use in all of their projects.

- In this task, you’ll be using the Backpack library to build a simple web application. The application you build will be a simple page for picking a date. Since Skyscanner helps people to research and book travel reservations, this is a functionality that gets a lot of use! The application you create will include the header text “Reservation Date,” a calendar, and a “continue” button.

## This task includes three stages: 

1. setting up your workspace, 
2. customising your application, and 
3. executing automated tests. 
- 
While this task only explores the basics of web application development with Backpack, it will allow you to tackle the process of creating applications with an eye for continuous integration. You’ll gain experience working with the tools that developers at Skyscanner use every day!

- Don't worry if you get lost, **we'll show you an example answer at the end.**
